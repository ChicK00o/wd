wd
==

Utility to store and set the current working directory (cwd) in a command-line
shell.

wd could be considered to be a system for bookmarking favourite directories 
and then quickly jumping back to those bookmarks

wd is intended to be very light-weight with a minimum of dependencies - that's
why it's implemented in C as opposed to (for example) Python.  It's also
intended to be independent of the shell (so, for example, it could be used on
the Windows command prompt as well as BASH).
